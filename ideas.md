  **Design Movement**: **Industrial Chic / Third Wave Coffee Aesthetic**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Raw & Refined**: Juxtaposition of rough textures (concrete, brick, kraft paper) with sleek, polished elements (matte black metal, glass).
  2.  **Process-Oriented**: Highlighting the craft of coffee making—machinery, beans, steam, and the pour.
  3.  **Minimalist Utility**: Everything has a purpose; no decorative fluff. Clean lines and functional layouts.
  4.  **Warmth in Void**: Using warm lighting and coffee tones to create inviting spaces within a starker industrial framework.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Palette**: Charcoal Black (#1A1A1A), Warm Concrete Grey (#8C8C8C), Unbleached Kraft Paper (#D6C6B0), Espresso Brown (#3B2F2F), and a pop of Copper/Bronze (#C87533).
  *   **Reasoning**: Evokes the physical space of a high-end roastery. The dark tones provide a premium feel, while the kraft and copper add organic warmth and reference the machinery and packaging.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Asymmetric Grid**: Breaking the standard 12-column grid with overlapping elements and off-center text blocks to create dynamic tension.
  *   **Split-Screen Hero**: Vertical division of imagery and typography, emphasizing the duality of product and service.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Monospace Typography**: Used for labels, prices, and technical details to reinforce the "utility" aspect.
  2.  **Line Art Illustrations**: Technical drawings of coffee equipment (V60, espresso machine portafilters) as background textures.
  3.  **Texture Overlays**: Subtle grain or paper texture on background containers to avoid flat digital colors.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons that feel "heavy" with solid borders and distinct hover states (e.g., fill change).
  *   **Smooth Scroll**: Parallax effects on background images to simulate depth.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Reveal**: Elements slide in from the bottom with a slight delay, mimicking the rising steam or the slow drip of cold brew.
  *   **Hover**: Images slightly desaturate or zoom in; text underlines expand from center.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: *Oswald* or *Bebas Neue* (Condensed Sans) – Bold, uppercase, commanding.
  *   **Body**: *Roboto Mono* (for details) mixed with *Lato* (for long text) – Clean, legible, technical.

  **Design Movement**: **Warm Minimalism / Japandi (Japanese-Scandi)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Serenity & Balance**: The interface should feel calm, uncluttered, and breathable.
  2.  **Natural Materials**: Visuals should evoke wood, ceramic, linen, and foam.
  3.  **Soft Geometry**: Rounded corners, organic shapes, and fluid lines rather than sharp edges.
  4.  **Light & Shadow**: Using soft, diffused shadows to create depth without heaviness.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Palette**: Cream/Off-White (#F9F7F2), Soft Sage Green (#A3B18A), Muted Terracotta (#D4A373), Sand (#E6CCB2), and Deep Slate for text (#2F3E46).
  *   **Reasoning**: Reflects the organic nature of coffee beans and the calming ritual of drinking coffee. It feels approachable, healthy, and artisanal.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Central Axis with Breathing Room**: Content flows down a central spine but with wide margins.
  *   **Card-Based with Soft Borders**: Content is grouped in "cards" that blend into the background with very subtle shadows or borders.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Organic Blobs**: Background shapes that are fluid and amorphous, breaking up the rectangular screen.
  2.  **Macro Photography**: Close-ups of coffee textures (foam bubbles, bean surface) used as soft backgrounds.
  3.  **Rounded Buttons**: Pill-shaped buttons that look friendly and touchable.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Gentle Flow**: Transitions are slow and ease-in/out. No abrupt movements.
  *   **Soft Focus**: Hover states might introduce a soft glow or a gentle lift (y-axis translation).

  **Animation**:
  *   **Fade & Float**: Elements gently fade in and float up.
  *   **Liquid Motion**: SVG morphing shapes in the background that move slowly like liquid.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: *Playfair Display* or *Lora* (Serif) – Elegant, human, editorial.
  *   **Body**: *Nunito* or *Quicksand* (Rounded Sans) – Friendly, soft, approachable.

  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism / Pop Art Coffee**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Bold & Unapologetic**: High contrast, loud colors, and a sense of fun.
  2.  **Raw Structure**: Visible borders, default system fonts (sometimes), and "ugly-cool" aesthetics.
  3.  **High Energy**: Geared towards a younger, energetic crowd that drinks coffee for the buzz.
  4.  **Flatness**: No shadows, no gradients. Just solid blocks of color and thick strokes.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Palette**: Electric Blue (#0000FF), Vibrant Orange (#FF5733), Bright Yellow (#FFC300), Stark White (#FFFFFF), and Pitch Black (#000000).
  *   **Reasoning**: Coffee is energy. The site should wake you up just like the product. It stands out from the sea of "brown and beige" coffee sites.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Modular Grid**: Distinct, bordered boxes for every piece of content. Like a comic strip or a spreadsheet gone wild.
  *   **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners (horizontal and vertical) to create constant motion.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Thick Strokes**: 2px-4px solid black borders on everything.
  2.  **Hard Shadows**: Solid black drop shadows offset by 4px-8px (no blur).
  3.  **Collage Imagery**: Cut-out photos of coffee cups placed on solid color backgrounds.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Clicky**: Buttons depress physically (translate X/Y) when clicked.
  *   **Instant**: No fades. Things toggle on/off instantly.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Ticker Tape**: Constant scrolling text.
  *   **Jitter**: Elements might vibrate slightly on hover.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: *Archivo Black* or *Syne* – Heavy, wide, impactful.
  *   **Body**: *Space Mono* or *Courier Prime* – Monospaced, raw, unrefined.
